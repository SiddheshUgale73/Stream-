ðŸ“Œ Snowflake Streams Overview

Snowflake Streams provide a Change Data Capture (CDC) mechanism to track row-level changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) in a source table.

They enable incremental data processing by recording only the changes since the last stream consumption.

Streams maintain internal metadata columns that specify the type of change and its state.

Different stream types (standard, append-only, insert-only) support varied use cases based on change-tracking requirements.

Once queried, the stream marks the tracked changes as consumed and only shows new changes thereafter.

Streams are widely used in ETL/ELT pipelines, data replication, and real-time analytics.

The MERGE statement is often paired with streams to apply captured changes to a target table.

They can be scheduled and automated when combined with Snowflake Tasks.

Streams eliminate the need for full table scans, making data pipelines cost-efficient and high-performing.

They are essential for building scalable, cloud-native data warehouse solutions in Snowflake.
